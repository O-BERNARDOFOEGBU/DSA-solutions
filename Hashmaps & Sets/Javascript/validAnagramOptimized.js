  //   If frequencyCounter[char] is undefined (i.e., the character hasn't been counted yet), the expression (frequencyCounter[char] || 0) will result in 0.
  //   If frequencyCounter[char] has a value (e.g., itâ€™s already been counted once or more), the expression (frequencyCounter[char] || 0) will result in the current count.

// Example usage:
console.log(isAnagram("anagram", "nagaram")); // Output: true
console.log(isAnagram("rat", "car")); // Output: false

// Complexity:
// Time Complexity: The solution runs in O(n) time, where n is the length of the strings. This is because we are iterating over each string once.
// Space Complexity: The space complexity is O(1) if we assume a fixed character set (e.g., only lowercase English letters), as the frequency counter will have at most 26 keys. Otherwise, it is O(n).
// This method is more efficient in terms of time complexity compared to the sorting approach, especially for larger strings.
